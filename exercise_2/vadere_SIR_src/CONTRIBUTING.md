# Contributing: Vadere

This guide explains the repository structure, how to set up the development environment and introduces coding guidelines.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains following `files` and `folders`:

- The Vadere source code: divided into the sofware modules `VadereGui`, `VadereMeshing`, `VaderSimulator`, `VadereState`, `VadereUtils`
- `Scenarios`: pre-shipped tests for different purposes and different locomotion models (e.g., gradient navigation model, optimal steps model and the social force model)
- `Tools`: scripts which are executing during the continuous integration phase.
- `.gitlab`: templates for creating issues in the Vadere [issue tracker](https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/vadere/issues) (this files are implicitly used by GitLab).
- `.gitlab-ci.yml`: instructions which are executed during the [continuous integration pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/).

## Development Setup

1. Follow the **installation instructions** in the [README.md](README.md) to install all required software and to get the source code.
2. Open a shell and `cd` into the project directory.
3. Run `mvn clean install`.

The project can now be imported *As Maven Project* into your IDE.

### Eclipse

1. *File* > *Import* > *Maven* > *Existing Maven Projects*
2. Choose `pom.xml` as *Root Directory* and click *Finish*
3. Open *Vaderegui (gui)* > *src* > *org.vadere.gui.projectview* > `Vadereapplication`

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. On the welcome-screen select *Import Project*
2. Select `pom.xml` > *Next* > *Next* > *Next* > *Finish*
3. Open *VadereGui (gui)* > *src* > *org.vadere.gui.projectview* > `VadereApplication`
4. lick the *run*-icon next to the `main` method
5. Edit the run configuration for `VadereApplication` to build the project using Maven instead of IntelliJ's internal builder to avoid compilation errors:
6. Click *Edit Configurations* (in dropdown menu next to the play/debug button)
7. Under *Before launch*, **remove all existing** build instructions and add *Run Maven Goal* and use the Maven goal `compile`

Alternatively, run `mvn eclipse:eclipse` using the [Maven Eclipse Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-eclipse-plugin/usage.html) or `mvn idea:idea` using the [Maven IntelliJ Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-idea-plugin/).

## Workflow

To efficiently contribute to this project, you need an LRZ GitLab account.
Please contact us and we will send you an invitation.

### Use the Issue Tracker

Please, use the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/vadere/issues?sort=label_priority) for both

- to request a feature or to report a bug (see [how to write new issues](https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/vadere/issues/179))
- to work on a feature (see [how to work on an issue](https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/vadere/issues/184))

**Tip:** Sort the issues in the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/vadere/issues?sort=label_priority) by `Label priority`.

### Steps for External Contributors

The workflow is the following:

1. **Fork this Git repository**
2. Clone your own fork to your computer
3. Checkout a new branch and work on your new feature or bugfix
4. Push your branch and **send us a merge request**

These steps are explained in more detail at the
[GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
Merge/pull requests are described [on GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/#mergepull-requests-with-gitlab-flow).

## Style Guides

### For Coding

Basic rules:

- No warnings
- No unused imports
- No unecessary `this.` qualifiers
- Use the formatting tool!
  - Eclipse: select text (optional) and press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd>
  - IntelliJ: select text (optional) and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd>

For source code formatting, we use an adapted version of
[Google's Coding style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
Please check the [README in this repository](https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/styleguide)
for the style guide and for how to import the style settings into your IDE.

### For Commit Messages

These are examples for a good commit messages:

```
Fix typo in introduction to user guide
```

```
Refactor model initialization

Extracting a new class ModelBuilder because this functionality might be
used in multiple places.
```

Rules:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

Source: http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

This article lists good reasons for each rule!
Reasons include:

 - Clean and consistent git-log that also fits in the GitLab user interface
 - Stick to Git standards, e.g. "Merge branch ..." and "Revert ..."

Rules 1, 3, and 4 never hurt and should always be applied.

### Miscellaneous

#### Author Tag in JavaDoc

If you make important contributions to a Java class, and especially if you feel
responsible for that class, please add yourself as an author to the class-level
JavaDoc.

Example:

```
/**
 * @author First Last
 * @author Given Sur
 */
public class Foo {
    ...
```

#### Tests Required

Especially if you implement new functionality, please also provide JUnit tests.
The test classes should be located in the `tests/` folder but in the same
package as the class under test.
