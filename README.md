# Machine learning in crowd modelling and simulation - MLCMS
# Winter semester 2021-2022

Solutions of the exercises from the master-praktikum course at the department of informatics, Technische Universität München - TUM for group C

## Exercise 1: Modelling of human crowds
Implementing a modelling software based in the *Cellular automaton* model

Implemented using Python and Pythons GUI library [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

## Exercise 2: Using and analysing simulation software
Getting to know an open source simulation software [Vadere](http://www.vadere.org/releases/), developed at the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at the Munich University of Applied Sciences.

## Exercise 3: Dynamical systems and bifurcation theory
Examining the properties of dynamical systems and bifurcation theory along with the notion of chaos dynamics. 

## Exercise 4: Representation of data
Simplify n-dimensional data sets to a lower dimensional data set with minimum loss of information. Methods used in the exercise: Principal component analysis, Diffusion Maps and Variational autoencoder. 

## Exercise 5: Extracting dynamical systems from data
Using linear and nonlinear function approximation methods in order to approximate vector fields via data. Using Takens theorem describing a lower bound on how many time-embedded states needed in order to sufficiently describe a state space.

## Final project: Learning dynamical systems from data, artificial neural network
Learning dynamical systems via neural networks, implemented using known numerical methods for solving ODEs: Eulers method and Runge-Kutta.
