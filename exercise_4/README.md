# Exercise 4: Representation of data

## Task 1: Principal component analysis
The task is solved in task_1.ipynb, utilising the software found in sw/pca.py

## Task 2: Diffusion Maps
The different parts of this exercise are solved in task_2_partx.ipynb. diffusion_map.py is a framework for applying a version of the diffusion map algorithm on a data set. periodic_data_set.py and swiss_roll_data_set.py are used to store the data in csv-files. (In the future we will rather use .npy files for simplicity and efficientcy)

## Task 3: Training a Variational Autoencoder on MNIST
A VAE is implemented using pythons tensorflow library. The task is solved in task_3.ipynb, and the software is in sw/vae.py.

## Task 4: Fire Evacuation Planning for the MI building
The plotting of the data set is found in task_4.ipynb.
